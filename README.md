# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
    Timely delivery is crucial for it ensures that the s/w meets market demands, alligns with business strategies and adheres to budget constraints.
    Project managers can;
        i.) Set realistic timelines and milestones,
        ii.) Use project mng tools to track progress.
        iii.) Regularly review and adjust plans as needed.

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
    It ensurers that the project stays within budget, maxing profits, and resourse utilisation.
    Strategies such as having a detailed budget plan, monitoring expenses, implementing cost-saving measures and conducting regular financial reviews can be enforced.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
    |Agile|                                                        |Waterfall|
    |pros                 |cons                                  |pros                      |cons  
    |Flexible|            |can be less predictable|              |Structured|               |Inflexible.|  
    |Iterative|           |may lack documentation|               |Predictable|              |Changes hard to implement.|
    |Promotes collabs.|   |requires continuous user involvement| |Has clear documentation.| |May have longer dev. cycles.|

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
    Agile may be beneficial for projects with evolving reequirements, where collabing is key - s/w dev. & digital marketing campaigns - while waterfall is suitable for projects with well-defined requirements such as construction projects/manufacturing.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
    i.) Implementing automated testing.
    ii.) Conducting regular code reviews.
    iii.) Maintaining detailed documentation
    High standards ensure reliability, user satisfaction and reduced maintanance costs.
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
    Defining the project scope ensures clear understanding of objectives, preventing scope screep.
    A Work Breakdown Structure breaks down the project into manageable tasks, helping allocate resources, estimate timelines and track progress effectively.
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
    A detailed project schedule helps in planning, resource allocation and tracking progress and a gnatt chart simplifies task mngmnt and idying potetial delays by visualising timelines, dependecies, and milestones.
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
    Clearly defining the problem ensures that the development process is focused, solutions are relevant and resources used efficiently, setting clear obj and expectatons.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
    I would describe it in terms of the benefits it provides, the problems it solves, and the value it adds to the target market.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
